OMA’s inference algorithm consists of three main phases. First, to infer homologous sequences (sequences of common ancestry), all-against-all Smith-Waterman alignments are computed and significant matches are retained. Second, to infer orthologous pairs (the subset of homologs related by speciation events), mutually closest homologs are identified based on evolutionary distances, taking into account distance inference uncertainty and the possibility for differential gene losses (for more details, see Roth et al 2008). Third, these orthologs are clustered in two different ways, which are useful for different purposes: 1) We identify cliques of orthologous pairs (“OMA groups” ), which are useful as marker genes for phylogenetic reconstruction and tend to be very specific; 2) We identify hierarchical orthologous groups (“HOGs”), groups of genes defined for particular taxonomic ranges and identify all genes that have descended from a common ancestral gene in that taxonomic range.\nSpecies information\nType Number species 2496 proteins 18871762 OMA groups 962065 deepest level HOGs 846849 proteins in a HOG 14029907 (74.3%) proteins in an OMA Group 13481594 (71.4%) Installation: To install this package, start R (version “4.2”) and enter:\nif (!require(\u0026quot;BiocManager\u0026quot;, quietly = TRUE)) install.packages(\u0026quot;BiocManager\u0026quot;) BiocManager::install(\u0026quot;OmaDB\u0026quot;) For older versions of R, please refer to the appropriate Bioconductor release.\nAplication: This little vignette shows you how to get started with the OmaDB package. For more details on the OMA project. Another useful function of the OmaDB package is its functionality to exactly and partially match sequences. A case of sequence as a example was provided in this vignette. 1.1.5 EggNOG Introduction: A hierarchical, functionally and phylogenetically annotated orthology resource based on 5090 organisms and 2502 viruses. The initial step in the EggNOG pipeline is the clustering of the 9.6 million proteins from 2031 genomes. Homology comparisons are executed by the SIMAP initiative and processed by the EggNOG orthology prediction pipeline. Orthologous groups are automatically generated by dividing species space into ‘core’ species, which are central for defining orthologous groups using the strict triangular criterion, and ‘periphery’ species.\nWeb server: EggNOG v5.0. 1.1.6 OrthoVenn2 Introduction: OrthoVenn is a powerful web platform for the comparison and analysis of whole-genome orthologous clusters among up to 12 species. A larger number of species, including 142 vertebrates, 71 metazoa, 65 protists, 94 fungi, 57 plants and 111 bacteria species, have been added in OrthoVenn2.\nInstallation: The tool provides three stand-alone installation versions: 1) Install Docker: The release of OrthoVenn2 as a Docker provides an isolated and self-contained package without the need to install dependencies and change environmental settings.\nVisit Official install document to install docker on your server.

The database of orthologs presents available protein descriptors, together with Gene Ontology and InterPro attributes, which serve to provide general descriptive annotations of the orthologous groups, and facilitate comprehensive orthology database querying. OrthoDB also provides computed evolutionary traits of orthologs, such as gene duplicability and loss profiles, divergence rates, sibling groups, and gene intron-exon architectures. OrthoDB can be queried using a gene name, identifier, annotation keywords, protein sequence, etc. Then it indexed many relevant identifiers of proteins and genes, including UniProtKB, Ensembl, InterPro, KEGG, GenBank, RefSeq, etc. Eukaryotes Prokaryotes 1,271 6,013 Web server: OrthoDB. 1.1.8 ORCAN Introduction: ORCAN (ORtholog sCANner) is a web-based meta-server for one-click evolutionary and functional annotation of protein sequences. The server combines information from the most popular orthology-prediction resources, including four tools and four online databases. Functional annotation utilizes five additional comparisons between the query and identified homologs, including: sequence similarity, protein domain architectures, functional motifs, Gene Ontology term assignments and a list of associated articles. Furthermore, the server uses a plurality-based rating system to evaluate the orthology relationships and to rank the reference proteins by their evolutionary and functional relevance to the query. - Web server: ORCAN\n1.1.9 KEGG Orthology Introduction: The KO (KEGG Orthology) database is a database of molecular functions represented in terms of functional orthologs, includig 8504 species(813 eukaryotes,7291 bacteria, 400 archaea). A functional ortholog is manually defined in the context of KEGG molecular networks, namely, KEGG pathway maps, BRITE hierarchies and KEGG modules. Each node of the network, such as a box in the KEGG pathway map, is given a KO identifier (called K number) as a functional ortholog defined from experimentally characterized genes and proteins in specific organisms, which are then used to assign orthologous genes in other organisms based on sequence similarity.\nWeb server: KEGG Orthology 1.1.10 InParanoid Introduction: InParanoid is a program for automatic identification of orthologs while differentiating between inparalogs and outparalogs. An InParanoid cluster is seeded by a reciprocally bestmatching ortholog pair, around which inparalogs are gathered independently, while outparalogs are excluded. The InParanoid database is a collection of pairwise ortholog groups aiming to include all ‘completely sequenced’ eukaryotic genomes.

New advantages and features of agriGO v2.0 are as follows: 1). The agriGO v2.0 focuses on agricultural species in particular. It supports species and datatypes. 2). A new species’ classification system, single species analysis and reference datatype priorities help users to perform fast and accurate analyses. 3). Analysis tools, including the Singular Enrichment Analysis (SEA), Parametric Analysis of Gene set Enrichment (PAGE), BLAST4ID (Transfer IDs by BLAST) and SEACOMPARE (Cross comparison of SEA) were retained. These tools provide users with means for data mining and systematic result exploration and will allow better data analyses and interpretations. 4). Custom analysis tools including custom direct acyclic graph (DAG) tree and Scatter Plot were developed. These tools increase input flexibility. 5). A Batch SEA tool of multiple inputs, such as time-course samples, was provided, as well as the distributions of the p-values (PVD) of the significant GO terms randomly generated.\nSpecies information\nCategory Classification Species counts Plant Brassicaceae 12 Poaceae 29 Malvaceae 6 Fabaceae 16 Solanaceae 12 Tree 29 Algae 18 Animal Fish 20 Aves 11 Amphibia 3 Insecta 56 Mammalia 58 Fungi Sordariomycetes 5 Web server: agriGO. 1.2.4 UniProtKB Introduction: The UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) is the central hub for the collection of functional information on proteins, with accurate, consistent and rich annotation. In addition to capturing the core data mandatory for each UniProtKB entry (mainly, the amino acid sequence, protein name or description, taxonomic data and citation information), as much annotation information as possible is added. This includes widely accepted biological ontologies, classifications and cross-references, and clear indications of the quality of annotation in the form of evidence attribution of experimental and computational data. The UniProt Knowledgebase consists of two sections: a section containing manually-annotated records with information extracted from literature and curator-evaluated computational analysis, and a section with computationally analyzed records that await full manual annotation. For the sake of continuity and name recognition, the two sections are referred to as “UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot” (reviewed, manually annotated) and “UniProtKB/TrEMBL” (unreviewed, automatically annotated), respectively.\nSPECIES: 250\nWeb server: UniProtKB. 1.2.5 PANTHER Introduction: The PANTHER (Protein ANalysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships) Classification System was designed to classify proteins (and their genes) in order to facilitate high-throughput analysis. The core of PANTHER is a comprehensive, annotated “library” of gene family phylogenetic trees. All nodes in the tree have persistent identifiers that are maintained between versions of PANTHER, providing a stable substrate for annotations of protein properties like subfamily and function. Each phylogenetic tree is used to annotate each protein member of the family by its: Family and Protein Class (supergrouping of protein families) Subfamily (subgroup within the family phylogenetic tree) Orthologs (genes in other organisms that derive from the same gene in the MRCA) Paralogs (genes in the same organism that are related by gene duplication) Function (using GO terms annotated on the trees by the GO Phylogenetic Annotation Project) Pathways (curated by PANTHER and by Reactome)\nDatabase information\nType Number species 143 pathways 177 Ontologies 3361 terms 2267 biological process terms 544 cellular component terms 550 molecular function terms Web server: PANTHER.

The cornerstone of Reactome is a freely available, open source relational database of signaling and metabolic molecules and their relations organized into biological pathways and processes. The core unit of the Reactome data model is the reaction. Entities (nucleic acids, proteins, complexes, vaccines, anti-cancer therapeutics and small molecules) participating in reactions form a network of biological interactions and are grouped into pathways. Examples of biological pathways in Reactome include classical intermediary metabolism, signaling, transcriptional regulation, apoptosis and disease. The Reactome curation process for a pathway is similar to the editing of a scientific review. An external domain expert provides his or her expertise, a curator formalizes it into the database structure, and an external domain expert reviews the representation. A system of evidence tracking ensures that all assertions are backed up by the primary literature. Reactome pathway, reaction and molecules pages extensively cross-reference to over 100 different online bioinformatics resources, including NCBI Gene, Ensembl and UniProt databases, the UCSC Genome Browser, ChEBI small molecule databases, and the PubMed literature database.

InterPro integrates protein signatures from 13 member databases, which use a variety of different methods to classify proteins. Each of the databases has a particular focus (e.g. protein domains defined from structure, or full length protein families with shared function).\nInterPro integrates signatures from the following 13 member databases: CATH, CDD, HAMAP, MobiDB Lite, Panther, Pfam, PIRSF, PRINTS, Prosite, SFLD, SMART, SUPERFAMILY AND TIGRfams.\nCATH-Gene3D The CATH-Gene3D database describes protein families and domain architectures in complete genomes. Protein families are formed using a Markov clustering algorithm, followed by multi-linkage clustering according to sequence identity. Mapping of predicted structure and sequence domains is undertaken using hidden Markov models libraries representing CATH and Pfam domains.\nCDD CDD is a protein annotation resource that consists of a collection of annotated multiple sequence alignment models for ancient domains and full-length proteins. These are available as position-specific score matrices (PSSMs) for fast identification of conserved domains in protein sequences via RPS-BLAST. CDD content includes NCBI-curated domain models, which use 3D-structure information to explicitly define domain boundaries and provide insights into sequence/structure/function relationships, as well as domain models imported from a number of external source databases.\nHAMAP HAMAP stands for High-quality Automated and Manual Annotation of Proteins. HAMAP profiles are manually created by expert curators. They identify proteins that are part of well-conserved protein families or subfamilies.\nMobiDB Lite MobiDB offers a centralized resource for annotations of intrinsic protein disorder. The database features three levels of annotation: manually curated, indirect and predicted. The different sources present a clear tradeoff between quality and coverage. By combining them all into a consensus annotation, MobiDB aims at giving the best possible picture of the “disorder landscape” of a given protein of interest.\nPANTHER PANTHER is a large collection of protein families that have been subdivided into functionally related subfamilies, using human expertise. These subfamilies model the divergence of specific functions within protein families, allowing more accurate association with function, as well as inference of amino acids important for functional specificity. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are built for each family and subfamily for classifying additional protein sequences.\nPfam Pfam is a large collection of multiple sequence alignments and hidden Markov models covering many common protein domains.\nPIRSF PIRSF protein classification system is a network with multiple levels of sequence diversity from superfamilies to subfamilies that reflects the evolutionary relationship of full-length proteins and domains.\nPRINTS PRINTS is a compendium of protein fingerprints. A fingerprint is a group of conserved motifs used to characterise a protein family or domain.\nPROSITE profiles PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains. It consists of biologically significant sites, patterns and profiles that help to reliably identify to which known protein family a new sequence belongs.\nSFLD SFLD (Structure-Function Linkage Database) is a hierarchical classification of enzymes that relates specific sequence-structure features to specific chemical capabilities.\nSMART SMART (a Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool) allows the identification and annotation of genetically mobile domains and the analysis of domain architectures.\nSUPERFAMILY SUPERFAMILY is a library of profile hidden Markov models that represent all proteins of known structure. The library is based on the SCOP classification of proteins: each model corresponds to a SCOP domain and aims to represent the entire SCOP superfamily that the domain belongs to.\nTIGRFAMs TIGRFAMs is a collection of protein families, featuring curated multiple sequence alignments, hidden Markov models (HMMs) and annotation, which provides a tool for identifying functionally related proteins based on sequence homology.\n4.2 UCSC Genome Browser database -Introduction: UCSC Genome Browser database is a web-based viewer for genome sequence data and annotations, the ability to juxtapose annotations of many types is one of the reasons for the popularity. The gene annotations including clinical variant interpretation, chromosome band location, pseudogene annotation, domain, cis-regulatory elements combination, organs/tissue/cell types annotation and so on.\n-Web server: UCSC\n1.4.2 UCSC Genome Browser database -Introduction: UCSC Genome Browser database is a web-based viewer for genome sequence data and annotations, the ability to juxtapose annotations of many types is one of the reasons for the popularity. The gene annotations including clinical variant interpretation, chromosome band location, pseudogene annotation, domain, cis-regulatory elements combination, organs/tissue/cell types annotation and gene interactions from curated databases and text-mining.\n-Web server: UCSC 1.4.3 MSigDB -Introduction: Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) is a resource of tens of thousands of annotated gene sets for use with GSEA software, divided into Human and Mouse collections.The 33196 gene sets in the Human Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) are divided into 9 major collections, and several sub-collections.\n-Web server: MSigDB 1.4.4 HumanBase -Introduction: HumanBase is a “one stop shop” for biological researchers interested in data-driven predictions of gene expression, function, regulation, and interactions in human, particularly in the context of specific cell types/tissues and human disease. This resource is not merely a public database of primary genomics data or biological literature. The data-driven integrative analyses (i.e. algorithms that “learn” from large genomic data collections) presented in HumanBase are especially powerful because they separate signal from noise in large biological data collections to reach beyond “existing biological knowledge” represented in the biological literature to identify novel associations that are not biased toward well-studied areas of biomedical research.\nData Source Statistics Type Resource number Ontology definitions 3 Gene annotations 3 Co-expression 980 Interaction 4 Genetic and chemical perturbations 1 MicroRNA targets 1 TF binding 1 -Web server: HumanBase HumanBase from the following six analysis tools:\nFunctional gene networks In order to leverage the vast collections of raw, noisy genomic data, they must be integrated, summarized, and presented in a biologically informative manner. We provide a means of mining tens of thousands of whole-genome experiments by way of functional interaction networks. Each interaction network represents a body of data, probabilistically weighted and integrated, focused on a particular biological question.\nTissue-specific gene networks (GIANT) HumanBase builds genome-scale functional maps of human tissues by integrating a collection of data sets covering thousands of experiments contained in more than 14,000 distinct publications. We automatically assess each data set for its relevance to each of 144 tissue- and cell lineage–specific functional contexts. The resulting functional gene maps provide a detailed portrait of protein function and interactions in specific human tissues and cell lineages ranging from B lymphocytes to the renal glomerulus and the whole brain. This approach allows HumanBase to profile the specialized function of genes in a high-throughput manner, even in tissues and cell lineages for which no or few tissue-specific data exist.\nFunctional module detection HumanBase applies community detection to find cohesive gene clusters from a provided gene list and a selected relevant tissue. Genes within a cluster share local network neighborhoods and together form a cohesive, specific functional module. Module detection enables systematic association of genes - even functionally uncharacterized genes - to specific processes and phenotypes represented in the detected modules. Functional modules are identified with tissue-specific networks, which predict gene interactions from massive data collections. Thus the discovered modules potentially capture higher-order tissue-specific function.\nGWAS re-prioritization (NetWAS) Tissue-specific networks provide a new means to generate hypotheses related to the molecular basis of human disease. In NetWAS, the statistical associations from a standard GWAS guide the analysis of functional networks. NetWAS, in conjunction with tissue-specific networks, effectively reprioritizes statistical associations from GWAS to identify disease-associated genes. This reprioritization method is driven by GWAS discovery and does not depend on prior disease knowledge.\nChromatin effects (Sei / DeepSEA) DeepSEA is a deep learning-based algorithmic framework for predicting the chromatin effects of sequence alterations with single nucleotide sensitivity. DeepSEA can accurately predict the epigenetic state of a sequence, including transcription factors binding, DNase I sensitivities and histone marks in multiple cell types, and further utilize this capability to predict the chromatin effects of sequence variants and prioritize regulatory variants. Sei provides a global map from any sequence to regulatory activities, as represented by 40 sequence classes by integrating predictions for 21,907 chromatin profiles.\nTissue-specific variant effects (ExPecto) ExPecto makes highly accurate cell-type-specific predictions of gene expression solely from DNA sequence. With ExPecto, the tissue-specific impact of gene transcriptional dysregulation can be systematically probed ‘in silico’, at a scale not yet possible experimentally. ExPecto leverages deep learning-based sequence models trained on chromatin profiling data, and integrated with spatial transformation and regularized linear models.\n1.4.5 DISGENET -Introduction: DISGENET plus is a discovery platform that integrates human gene and variant-disease associations from various expert curated databases and the scientific literature. Information extracted from expert-curated resources and directly from the literature using state-of-the-art text mining technologies (92 % F-score).
