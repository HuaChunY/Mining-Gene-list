Second, to infer orthologous pairs (the subset of homologs related by speciation events), mutually closest homologs are identified based on evolutionary distances, taking into account distance inference uncertainty and the possibility for differential gene losses (for more details, see Roth et al 2008). Third, these orthologs are clustered in two different ways, which are useful for different purposes: 1) We identify cliques of orthologous pairs (‚ÄúOMA groups‚Äù ), which are useful as marker genes for phylogenetic reconstruction and tend to be very specific; 2) We identify hierarchical orthologous groups (‚ÄúHOGs‚Äù), groups of genes defined for particular taxonomic ranges and identify all genes that have descended from a common ancestral gene in that taxonomic range.\nSpecies information Type Number species 2496 proteins 18871762 OMA groups 962065 deepest level HOGs 846849 proteins in a HOG 14029907 (74.3%) proteins in an OMA Group 13481594 (71.4%) Installation: To install this package, start R (version ‚Äú4.2‚Äù) and enter:\nif (!require(\u0026quot;BiocManager\u0026quot;, quietly = TRUE)) install.packages(\u0026quot;BiocManager\u0026quot;) BiocManager::install(\u0026quot;OmaDB\u0026quot;) For older versions of R, please refer to the appropriate Bioconductor release.\nAplication: This little vignette shows you how to get started with the OmaDB package.

Furthermore, it has interactive heatmaps of hierarchically clustered matrices of all signatures.\nWeb server: CREEDS. 4.1.3 L1000CDS¬≤ Introduction: L1000CDS¬≤ is a LINCS L1000 characteristic direction signature search engine. It enables users to find consensus L1000 small molecule signatures that match user input signatures. The underlying dataset for the search engine is a portion of the LINCS L1000 small molecule expression profiles generated at the Broad Institute by the Connectivity Map team. The differentially expressed (DE) genes of these profiles were calculated using the characteristic direction method. Depending on the user‚Äôs input, L1000CDS¬≤ uses either a gene-set method or cosine distance method to compare the input signatures to the L1000 signatures to perform the search. When up/down gene lists are submitted to L1000CDS¬≤, the search engine compares the input gene lists to the DE genes computed from the LINCS L1000 data and descriptive information of the top 50 matched signatures is returned. When a signature is submitted to L1000CDS¬≤ in the format of ‚Äúgene symbol, expression value‚Äù, the search engine calculates a cosine distance between the input signature and every characteristic direction signature in the underlying dataset, and the top 50 signatures of either the largest (reverse mode) or the smallest (mimic mode) cosine distances are returned. L1000CDS¬≤ leverages the efficiency of matrix operations to perform the search. The search finishes a query against more than 20,000 signatures in less than a decisecond using the gene-set method or less than 4 seconds using the cosine distance method.\nL1000CDS¬≤ emained with 33,197 significant signatures served by the default search.These signatures cover 62 unique cell-lines and 3,924 different small molecues.

It is based on network theory and non-parametric statistics on gene expression data. In order to study a novel drug users have to give to MANTRA one or more genome-wide ranked list of genes sorted according to their differential expression in a treatment with the drug. On the basis of this input, MANTRA automatically integrates this novel drug in a huge network of compounds in which the topology reveals similarities and differences in MoA. To make novel hypothesis on known and FDA approved drugs, hence to find ‚Äúrepositionable drugs‚Äù, users have just to explore this drug network.\nApplication: The Mantra tutorial can be found at https://mantra.tigem.it/About/MantraTutorial.pdf.\nWeb server: Mantra. 4.1.9 DvD Introduction: Drug versus Disease (DvD) provides a pipeline, available through R or Cytoscape, for the comparison of drug and disease gene expression profiles from public microarray repositories.

TissueEnrich enables users to provide the background genes for carrying out tissue-specific gene enrichment. In this case, instead of using all the genes in the dataset, a background gene set is being used to carry out the enrichment analysis. It should be noted that the background gene set must have all the genes of the input gene set. Installation: To install this package, start R (version 3.6 or higher) and enter:\nBiocManager::install(\u0026quot;TissueEnrich\u0026quot;) TissueEnrich R package can be easily installed from Github using devtools https://github.com/Tuteja-Lab/TissueEnrich:\ninstall.packages(\u0026quot;devtools\u0026quot;) library(devtools) install_github(\u0026quot;Tuteja-Lab/TissueEnrich\u0026quot;) Application: More examples can download from here.\nWeb server: TissueEnrich 5.1.8 ORGANizer Introduction: Gene ORGANizer is a tool designed to allow users to analyze the relationships between genes and organs.

For each query, we will generate cell-type-specific enrichment analysis (CSEA) raw p-value, combined p-value by permutation-based method, genes shared between queried gene list and tissue-cell-type signatures, heatmap that interactively displays the cell-type specificity across 1,355 human tissue-cell types (TCs), summary of cell-type specificity by human organ system and top-ranked tissues and general cell types. Users can also filter, prioritize, and compare the CSEA results from cell types from one or multiple tissues. Users can further download all the results of CSEA and visualize them. Overall, WebCSEA provides a comprehensive map of major human TCs and uses a permutation-based method to overcome the bias raised from different lengths of signature genes among TCs as well as the length of query genes.\nWebCSEA team manually curated more than 5.5 million cells from 111 human tissues panels and 1,355 TCs from 61 adult and fetal tissues across 12 human organ systems (11 organ systems + sensory system). We used our t-statistic method to obtain the tissue-cell-type signatures panel by tissue. To construct a biological meaningful gene set for permutation shuffle, we curated ~5,600 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and ~3,700 rare-variants association phenotypes from UK BioBank, GWAS catalog, and Genebass for trait-associated gene sets (TAGs). After stringent quality control criteria, we permutated the null model as a matrix of 19,663 TAGs by 1,355 TCs. For each inquiry gene list, we conduct CSEA across 1,355 TCs and get the permutated p-values by ranking among 19,663 TAGs and 1,355 TCs. Then we use Fisher‚Äôs method to combine an overall p-value from the permutated p-values by TAGs and by TCs. Application: More examples can download from here.

It specifically focuses on agricultural species and is user-friendly. AgriGO v2.0 is designed to provide deep support to the agricultural community in the realm of ontology analyses. New advantages and features of agriGO v2.0 are as follows: 1). The agriGO v2.0 focuses on agricultural species in particular. It supports species and datatypes. 2). A new species‚Äô classification system, single species analysis and reference datatype priorities help users to perform fast and accurate analyses. 3). Analysis tools, including the Singular Enrichment Analysis (SEA), Parametric Analysis of Gene set Enrichment (PAGE), BLAST4ID (Transfer IDs by BLAST) and SEACOMPARE (Cross comparison of SEA) were retained. These tools provide users with means for data mining and systematic result exploration and will allow better data analyses and interpretations. 4). Custom analysis tools including custom direct acyclic graph (DAG) tree and Scatter Plot were developed. These tools increase input flexibility. 5). A Batch SEA tool of multiple inputs, such as time-course samples, was provided, as well as the distributions of the p-values (PVD) of the significant GO terms randomly generated.\nSpecies information Category Classification Species counts Plant Brassicaceae 12 Poaceae 29 Malvaceae 6 Fabaceae 16 Solanaceae 12 Tree 29 Algae 18 Animal Fish 20 Aves 11 Amphibia 3 Insecta 56 Mammalia 58 Fungi Sordariomycetes 5 Web server: agriGO. 1.2.4 UniProtKB Introduction: The UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) is the central hub for the collection of functional information on proteins, with accurate, consistent and rich annotation. In addition to capturing the core data mandatory for each UniProtKB entry (mainly, the amino acid sequence, protein name or description, taxonomic data and citation information), as much annotation information as possible is added. This includes widely accepted biological ontologies, classifications and cross-references, and clear indications of the quality of annotation in the form of evidence attribution of experimental and computational data.\nThe UniProt Knowledgebase consists of two sections: a section containing manually-annotated records with information extracted from literature and curator-evaluated computational analysis, and a section with computationally analyzed records that await full manual annotation. For the sake of continuity and name recognition, the two sections are referred to as ‚ÄúUniProtKB/Swiss-Prot‚Äù (reviewed, manually annotated) and ‚ÄúUniProtKB/TrEMBL‚Äù (unreviewed, automatically annotated), respectively.\nSPECIES: 250\nWeb server: UniProtKB. 1.2.5 PANTHER Introduction: The PANTHER (Protein ANalysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships) Classification System was designed to classify proteins (and their genes) in order to facilitate high-throughput analysis. The core of PANTHER is a comprehensive, annotated ‚Äúlibrary‚Äù of gene family phylogenetic trees. All nodes in the tree have persistent identifiers that are maintained between versions of PANTHER, providing a stable substrate for annotations of protein properties like subfamily and function. Each phylogenetic tree is used to annotate each protein member of the family by its: Family and Protein Class (supergrouping of protein families) Subfamily (subgroup within the family phylogenetic tree) Orthologs (genes in other organisms that derive from the same gene in the MRCA) Paralogs (genes in the same organism that are related by gene duplication) Function (using GO terms annotated on the trees by the GO Phylogenetic Annotation Project) Pathways (curated by PANTHER and by Reactome)\nDatabase information Type Number species 143 pathways 177 Ontologies 3361 terms 2267 biological process terms 544 cellular component terms 550 molecular function terms Web server: PANTHER. 1.2.6 GOrilla Introduction: GOrilla is a web-based application that identifies enriched GO terms in ranked lists of genes, without requiring the user to provide explicit target and background sets. This is particularly useful in many typical cases where genomic data may be naturally represented as a ranked list of genes (e.g.¬†by level of expression or of differential expression).GOrilla employs a flexible threshold statistical approach to discover GO terms that are significantly enriched at the top of a ranked gene list.\nWeb server: GOrilla. 1.2.7 WEGO 2.0 Introduction: WEGO uses the GO annotation results as input. Based on GO‚Äôs standardized DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) structured vocabulary system, the number of genes corresponding to each GO ID is calculated and shown in a graphical format. WEGO 2.0 updates have targeted four aspects, aiming to provide a more efficient and upto-date approach for comparative genomic analyses.\nWeb server: WEGO 2.0. 1.2.8 GOEAST Introduction: Gene Ontology Enrichment Analysis Software Toolkit (GOEAST), an easy-to-use web-based toolkit that identifies statistically overrepresented GO terms within given gene sets. Compared with available GO analysis tools, GOEAST has the following improved features: (i) GOEAST displays enriched GO terms in graphical format according to their relationships in the hierarchical tree of each GO category (biological process, molecular function and cellular component), therefore, provides better understanding of the correlations among enriched GO terms; (ii) GOEAST supports analysis for data from various sources (probe or probe set IDs of Affymetrix, Illumina, Agilent or customized microarrays, as well as different gene identifiers) and multiple species (about 60 prokaryote and eukaryote species); (iii) One unique feature of GOEAST is to allow cross comparison of the GO enrichment status of multiple experiments to identify functional correlations among them.\nWeb server: GOEAST. 1.2.9 ShinyGO Introduction: ShinyGO based on a large annotation database derived from Ensembl and STRING-db for 59 plant, 256 animal, 115 archeal and 1678 bacterial species. ShinyGO‚Äôs novel features include graphical visualization of enrichment results and gene characteristics, and application program interface access to KEGG and STRING for the retrieval of pathway diagrams and protein‚Äìprotein interaction networks.\nWeb server: ShinyGO. 1.2.10 GOTermFinder Introduction: GOTermFinder comprises a set of objectoriented Perl modules for accessing Gene Ontology (GO) information and evaluating and visualizing the collective annotation of a list of genes to GO terms. It can be used to draw conclusions from microarray and other biological data, calculating the statistical significance of each annotation. GO::TermFinder can be used on any system on which Perl can be run, either as a command line application, in single or batch mode, or as a web-based CGI script.\nWeb server: GOTermFinder. "

Most TFs recognize and bind to specific DNA sequences named as transcription factor biding sites, leading to specific spatiotemporal expression patterns of target genes.\nBreaking: Four TF target specific resources are collected.\n2.2.1 JASPAR Introduction: JASPAR is a regularly maintained open-access database storing manually curated transcription factors (TF) binding profiles as position frequency matrices (PFMs). PFMs summarize occurrences of each nucleotide at each position in a set of observed TF-DNA interactions. PFMs can be transformed to probabilistic or energistic models to construct position weight matrices (PWMs) or position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs), which can be used to scan any DNA sequence to predict TF binding sites (TFBSs). The JASPAR database provides TFBSs predicted using the profiles in the CORE collection. Installation: Different releases of JASPAR can also be accessed through Bioconductor data packages. Currently four JASPAR releases are available, and to install those packages, start R (version ‚Äú4.2‚Äù) and enter: + JASPAR2020:\nif (!require(\u0026quot;BiocManager\u0026quot;, quietly = TRUE)) install.packages(\u0026quot;BiocManager\u0026quot;) BiocManager::install(\u0026quot;JASPAR2020\u0026quot;) JASPAR2018 if (!require(\u0026quot;BiocManager\u0026quot;, quietly = TRUE)) install.packages(\u0026quot;BiocManager\u0026quot;) BiocManager::install(\u0026quot;JASPAR2018\u0026quot;) JASPAR2016 if (!require(\u0026quot;BiocManager\u0026quot;, quietly = TRUE)) install.packages(\u0026quot;BiocManager\u0026quot;) BiocManager::install(\u0026quot;JASPAR2016\u0026quot;) JASPAR2014 if (!require(\u0026quot;BiocManager\u0026quot;, quietly = TRUE)) install.packages(\u0026quot;BiocManager\u0026quot;) BiocManager::install(\u0026quot;JASPAR2014\u0026quot;) Application: The JASPAR tutorial can be found athttps://jaspar.genereg.net/docs/.

The cornerstone of Reactome is a freely available, open source relational database of signaling and metabolic molecules and their relations organized into biological pathways and processes. The core unit of the Reactome data model is the reaction. Entities (nucleic acids, proteins, complexes, vaccines, anti-cancer therapeutics and small molecules) participating in reactions form a network of biological interactions and are grouped into pathways. Examples of biological pathways in Reactome include classical intermediary metabolism, signaling, transcriptional regulation, apoptosis and disease. The Reactome curation process for a pathway is similar to the editing of a scientific review. An external domain expert provides his or her expertise, a curator formalizes it into the database structure, and an external domain expert reviews the representation. A system of evidence tracking ensures that all assertions are backed up by the primary literature. Reactome pathway, reaction and molecules pages extensively cross-reference to over 100 different online bioinformatics resources, including NCBI Gene, Ensembl and UniProt databases, the UCSC Genome Browser, ChEBI small molecule databases, and the PubMed literature database.\nSPECIES PROTEINS COMPLEXES REACTIONS PATHWAYS S. pombe 1690 1805 1486 819 S. cerevisiae 1913 1827 1566 812 D. rerio 8633 8452 7383 1676 X. tropicalis 7046 7321 6159 1580 G. gallus 7296 7931 6859 1706 S. scrofa 8407 8825 7548 1660 B. taurus 8841 9182 8048 1696 C. familiaris 8162 8725 7455 1657 R. norvegicus 8808 9505 8356 1702 M. musculus 9537 10620 9456 1715 H. sapiens 11097 14084 14398 2601 D. melanogaster 4755 5402 4596 1477 C. elegans 4468 4403 3700 1304 D. discoideum 2681 2502 2313 982 P. falciparum 1051 1007 861 599 Database information Web server: Biocarta. 1.3.5 PANTHER Introduction: The PANTHER (Protein ANalysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships) Classification System was designed to classify proteins (and their genes) in order to facilitate high-throughput analysis.

It relies on a comprehensive database of known LR interactions, which we called LRdb. It also introduces a new regularized product score aimed at adapting to variable levels of depth in single-cell datasets, i.e.¬†the prevalence of censored read counts or dropouts. LRdb is the result of integrating and curating existing sources plus manual additions. The new scoring approach has the advantage of facilitating the use of stable thresholds on LR interaction scores to control false positives (FPs) and not only rank LR interactions. Installation: To install this package, start R (version ‚Äú4.2‚Äù) and enter:\nif (!require(\u0026quot;BiocManager\u0026quot;, quietly = TRUE)) install.packages(\u0026quot;BiocManager\u0026quot;) BiocManager::install(\u0026quot;SingleCellSignalR\u0026quot;) 5.4.16 CellCall Introduction: CellCall is a toolkit to infer intercellular communication networks and internal regulatory signals by integrating intracellular and intercellular signaling. (1) CellCall collects ligand-receptor-transcript factor (L-R-TF) axis datasets based on KEGG pathways. (2) According to prior knowledge of L-R-TF interactions, CellCall infers intercellular communication by combining the expression of ligands/receptors and downstream TF activities for certain L-R pairs. (3) CellCall embeds a pathway activity analysis method to identify the crucial pathways involved in communications between certain cell types. (4) CellCall offers a rich suite of visualization options (Circos plot, Sankey plot, bubble plot, ridge plot, etc.) to intuitively present the analysis results. The overview figure of CellCall is shown as follows.\nInstallation: To install this package, start R (version 3.6 or higher) and enter:\nlibrary(devtools) devtools::install_github(\u0026quot;ShellyCoder/cellcall\u0026quot;) Application: More examples can download from here.\n5.4.17 TraSig Introduction: TraSig (Trajectory-based Signalling genes inference) identifies interacting cell types pairs and significant ligand-receptors based on the expression of genes as well as the pseudo-time ordering of cells.

InterPro integrates protein signatures from 13 member databases, which use a variety of different methods to classify proteins. Each of the databases has a particular focus (e.g.¬†protein domains defined from structure, or full length protein families with shared function).\nInterPro integrates signatures from the following 13 member databases: CATH, CDD, HAMAP, MobiDB Lite, Panther, Pfam, PIRSF, PRINTS, Prosite, SFLD, SMART, SUPERFAMILY AND NCBIfam.\nCATH-Gene3D The CATH-Gene3D database describes protein families and domain architectures in complete genomes. Protein families are formed using a Markov clustering algorithm, followed by multi-linkage clustering according to sequence identity. Mapping of predicted structure and sequence domains is undertaken using hidden Markov models libraries representing CATH and Pfam domains.\nCDD CDD is a protein annotation resource that consists of a collection of annotated multiple sequence alignment models for ancient domains and full-length proteins. These are available as position-specific score matrices (PSSMs) for fast identification of conserved domains in protein sequences via RPS-BLAST. CDD content includes NCBI-curated domain models, which use 3D-structure information to explicitly define domain boundaries and provide insights into sequence/structure/function relationships, as well as domain models imported from a number of external source databases.\nHAMAP HAMAP stands for High-quality Automated and Manual Annotation of Proteins. HAMAP profiles are manually created by expert curators. They identify proteins that are part of well-conserved protein families or subfamilies.\nMobiDB Lite MobiDB offers a centralized resource for annotations of intrinsic protein disorder. The database features three levels of annotation: manually curated, indirect and predicted. The different sources present a clear tradeoff between quality and coverage. By combining them all into a consensus annotation, MobiDB aims at giving the best possible picture of the ‚Äúdisorder landscape‚Äù of a given protein of interest.\nPANTHER PANTHER is a large collection of protein families that have been subdivided into functionally related subfamilies, using human expertise. These subfamilies model the divergence of specific functions within protein families, allowing more accurate association with function, as well as inference of amino acids important for functional specificity. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are built for each family and subfamily for classifying additional protein sequences.\nPfam Pfam is a large collection of multiple sequence alignments and hidden Markov models covering many common protein domains.\nPIRSF PIRSF protein classification system is a network with multiple levels of sequence diversity from superfamilies to subfamilies that reflects the evolutionary relationship of full-length proteins and domains.\nPRINTS PRINTS is a compendium of protein fingerprints. A fingerprint is a group of conserved motifs used to characterise a protein family or domain.\nPROSITE profiles PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains. It consists of biologically significant sites, patterns and profiles that help to reliably identify to which known protein family a new sequence belongs.\nSFLD SFLD (Structure-Function Linkage Database) is a hierarchical classification of enzymes that relates specific sequence-structure features to specific chemical capabilities.\nSMART SMART (a Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool) allows the identification and annotation of genetically mobile domains and the analysis of domain architectures.\nSUPERFAMILY SUPERFAMILY is a library of profile hidden Markov models that represent all proteins of known structure. The library is based on the SCOP classification of proteins: each model corresponds to a SCOP domain and aims to represent the entire SCOP superfamily that the domain belongs to.\nNCBIfam 1.5.2 UCSC Genome Browser database Introduction: UCSC Genome Browser database is a web-based viewer for genome sequence data and annotations, the ability to juxtapose annotations of many types is one of the reasons for the popularity. The gene annotations including clinical variant interpretation, chromosome band location, pseudogene annotation, domain, cis-regulatory elements combination, organs/tissue/cell types annotation and gene interactions from curated databases and text-mining.\nWeb server: UCSC 1.5.3 MSigDB Introduction: Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) is a resource of tens of thousands of annotated gene sets for use with GSEA software, divided into Human and Mouse collections.The 33196 gene sets in the Human Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) are divided into 9 major collections, and several sub-collections.\nWeb server: MSigDB 1.5.4 HumanBase Introduction: HumanBase is a ‚Äúone stop shop‚Äù for biological researchers interested in data-driven predictions of gene expression, function, regulation, and interactions in human, particularly in the context of specific cell types/tissues and human disease. This resource is not merely a public database of primary genomics data or biological literature. The data-driven integrative analyses (i.e.¬†algorithms that ‚Äúlearn‚Äù from large genomic data collections) presented in HumanBase are especially powerful because they separate signal from noise in large biological data collections to reach beyond ‚Äúexisting biological knowledge‚Äù represented in the biological literature to identify novel associations that are not biased toward well-studied areas of biomedical research.\nData Source Statistics Type Resource number Ontology definitions 3 Gene annotations 3 Co-expression 980 Interaction 4 Genetic and chemical perturbations 1 MicroRNA targets 1 TF binding 1 Web server: HumanBase HumanBase from the following six analysis tools:\nFunctional gene networks In order to leverage the vast collections of raw, noisy genomic data, they must be integrated, summarized, and presented in a biologically informative manner. We provide a means of mining tens of thousands of whole-genome experiments by way of functional interaction networks. Each interaction network represents a body of data, probabilistically weighted and integrated, focused on a particular biological question.\nTissue-specific gene networks (GIANT) HumanBase builds genome-scale functional maps of human tissues by integrating a collection of data sets covering thousands of experiments contained in more than 14,000 distinct publications. We automatically assess each data set for its relevance to each of 144 tissueand cell lineage‚Äìspecific functional contexts. The resulting functional gene maps provide a detailed portrait of protein function and interactions in specific human tissues and cell lineages ranging from B lymphocytes to the renal glomerulus and the whole brain. This approach allows HumanBase to profile the specialized function of genes in a high-throughput manner, even in tissues and cell lineages for which no or few tissue-specific data exist.\nFunctional module detection HumanBase applies community detection to find cohesive gene clusters from a provided gene list and a selected relevant tissue. Genes within a cluster share local network neighborhoods and together form a cohesive, specific functional module. Module detection enables systematic association of genes even functionally uncharacterized genes to specific processes and phenotypes represented in the detected modules. Functional modules are identified with tissue-specific networks, which predict gene interactions from massive data collections. Thus the discovered modules potentially capture higher-order tissue-specific function.\nGWAS re-prioritization (NetWAS) Tissue-specific networks provide a new means to generate hypotheses related to the molecular basis of human disease. In NetWAS, the statistical associations from a standard GWAS guide the analysis of functional networks. NetWAS, in conjunction with tissue-specific networks, effectively reprioritizes statistical associations from GWAS to identify disease-associated genes. This reprioritization method is driven by GWAS discovery and does not depend on prior disease knowledge.\nChromatin effects (Sei / DeepSEA) DeepSEA is a deep learning-based algorithmic framework for predicting the chromatin effects of sequence alterations with single nucleotide sensitivity. DeepSEA can accurately predict the epigenetic state of a sequence, including transcription factors binding, DNase I sensitivities and histone marks in multiple cell types, and further utilize this capability to predict the chromatin effects of sequence variants and prioritize regulatory variants. Sei provides a global map from any sequence to regulatory activities, as represented by 40 sequence classes by integrating predictions for 21,907 chromatin profiles.\nTissue-specific variant effects (ExPecto) ExPecto makes highly accurate cell-type-specific predictions of gene expression solely from DNA sequence. With ExPecto, the tissue-specific impact of gene transcriptional dysregulation can be systematically probed ‚Äòin silico‚Äô, at a scale not yet possible experimentally. ExPecto leverages deep learning-based sequence models trained on chromatin profiling data, and integrated with spatial transformation and regularized linear models.\n1.5.5 DISGENET Introduction: DISGENET plus is a discovery platform that integrates human gene and variant-disease associations from various expert curated databases and the scientific literature.
