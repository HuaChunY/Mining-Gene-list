The cell marks are widely used to label cell types for individual cells, enabling capture of the initial viewing of cell compositions. The large amount of cell markers from experimental researches and scRNA-seq were identified. In particular, the core cell type-specific DEGs recommended as cell markers contribute to the cell annotation. As well, the developmental and tissue-related DEGs as cell markers will help the cell annotation of spatial and temporal expression pattens. Meanwhile, the proportions of cell types enable to quantitatively estimate by deconvolution algorithms based on cell type-specific markers. 

**Breaking**: This document provides more than 40 databases and tools about cell markers and deconvolution algorithms.

## 6.2.1.1 **CIERSORT**

**Introduction**: CIBERSORT( or CIBERSORTx) is a gene expression-based deconvolution algorithm that provides an estimation of the abundances of member cell types in a mixed cell population using gene expression data. CIBERSORTx allows users to process gene expression data representing a bulk admixture of different cell types, along with a signature matrix file that enumerates the genes defining the expression profile for each cell type of interest. For the latter, users can either use exissting/curated signature matrices for reference cell types, or can create custom signature gene files by providing the reference gene expression profiles o of pure cell populations. Moreover, given the increasing use of single cell transcriptome sequencing, CIBERSORTx also provides the option to derive signature matrices from sinqle-cell RNA sequencing data.

## 6.2.1.2 **ESTIMATE**

**Introduction**: ESTIMATE (Estimation of STromal and Immune cells in MAlignant Tumor tissues using Expression data) provides researchers with scores for tumor purity, the level of stromal cells present, and the infiltration level of immune cells in tumor tissues based on expression data. This website is designed to view and download stromal, immune, and ESTIMATE scores for each sample across all TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) tumor types and platforms. ESTIMATE algorithm is based on single sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis and generates three scores:
 1.stromal score (that captures the presence of stroma in tumor tissue),
 2.immune score (that represents the infiltration of immune cells in tumor tissue), and
 3.estimate score (that infers tumor purity).

**Installation**: In early October 2016, the ESTIMATE R package was migrated to R-Forge:
```{r eval=FALSE}
library(utils)

## 6.2.1.6 **EPIC**

This method could however also be applied to predict the cell fractions in other types of mixed samples if reference gene expression profiles from these other cell types are available.

## 6.2.1.38 **MOMF**

**Introduction**:  MOMF (Multi-Omics Matrix Factorization) is a package, to estimate the cell-type compositions of bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data by leveraging cell type-specific gene expression levels from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. MOMF not only directly models the count nature of gene expression data, but also effectively accounts for the uncertainty of cell type-specific mean gene expression levels. 

**Installation**: 
```{r eval=FALSE}
### install devtools packages (devtools package)
install.packages("devtools")

### install MOMF package
devtools::install_github("sqsun/MOMF")
```
**Application**: More examples can download from <https://github.com/sqsun/MOMF>.

## 6.2.1.39 **Deblender**

**Introduction**: Deblender is a flexible complete deconvolution tool operating in semi−/unsupervised mode based on the user’s access to known marker gene lists and information about cell/tissue composition. In case of no prior knowledge, global gene expression variability is used in clustering the mixed data to substitute marker sets with cluster sets. 

**Installation**: Deblender is implemented in MATLAB and is available from <https://github.com/kondim1983/Deblender/>.

## 6.2.1.40 **Lishuang Qi *et al.* **

**Introduction**: A modified semi-supervised nonnegative matrix factorization method for gene expression deconvolution.

**Installation**: The deconvolution algorithms can be found here: <https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0100934>

## 6.2.1.41 **MIXTURE**

**Introduction**: An analytical method based on a noise constrained recursive variable selection for a support vector regression. The MIXTURE shiny App has been only tested on Linux. The RUN_MIXTURE code was tested on Linux, Windows and Mac. On windows only one CPU core is allowed.

**Installation**: MIXTURE is implemented in Python and R at <https://github.com/elmerfer/MIXTURE.App>.

**Application**: More examples can download from <https://github.com/elmerfer/MIXTURE.App>.

## 6.2.1.43 **DTD**

**Introduction**: DTD (Digital Tissue Deconvolution) reconstructs the cellular composition of a tissue from its bulk expression profile. In order to increase deconvolution accuracy, DTD adapts the deconvolution model to the tissue scenario via loss-function learning.
Training is performed on 'in-silicio' training mixtures, for which the cellular composition are known.
As input, DTD requires a labelled expression matrix. The package includes functions to generate training and test mixtures, train the model, and assess its deconvolution capability via visualizations.

**Installation**: Install from github, without vignette:
```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("spang-lab/DTD")
```
 Install from github with vignette (creating vignettes approximately takes ~3 minutes):
```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github(
    "spang-lab/DTD", 
    build_opts = c("--no-resave-data", "--no-manual"), 
    build_vignettes=TRUE)

browseVignettes("DTD")
```
 
**Application**: More examples can download from <https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/MarianSchoen/Exemplary-DTD-analysis/blob/master/2019_04_12_DTD_melanoma.html>.
