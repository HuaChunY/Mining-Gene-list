## 5.3.1 **slingshot**
![](/images/slingshot_sticker.png?width=20pc)

**Introduction**: Provides functions for inferring continuous, branching lineage structures in low-dimensional data. Slingshot was designed to model developmental trajectories in single-cell RNA sequencing data and serve as a component in an analysis pipeline after dimensionality reduction and clustering. It is flexible enough to handle arbitrarily many branching events and allows for the incorporation of prior knowledge through supervised graph construction.

**Installation**: To install this package, start R and enter:

```{r eval=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly=TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("kstreet13/slingshot")
```

Python Version: An implementation of the Slingshot algorithm in python can be found here: <https://github.com/mossjacob/pyslingshot>

## 5.3.2 **CellRank**

**Introduction**: CellRank is a toolkit to uncover cellular dynamics based on Markov state modeling of single-cell data. It contains two main modules: kernels compute cell-cell transition probabilities and estimators generate hypothesis based on these. 

**Installation**: CellRank requires Python version >= 3.7 to run. We recommend using Miniconda to manage the environments.

CellRank can be installed via:
```{python eval=FALSE}
conda install -c conda-forge -c bioconda cellrank
# or with extra libraries, useful for large datasets
conda install -c conda-forge -c bioconda cellrank-krylov
```
 
**Web server**: [CellRank](https://cellrank.org/).

## 5.3.3 **CytoTree**
![](/images/CytoTree.png?width=15pc)

**Introduction**: CytoTree, an R/Bioconductor package for trajectory inference, pseudotime estimation and visualization of flow and mass cytometry data. The CytoTree package offers a complete up-to-date analysis workflow for flow and mass cytometry data that includes subpopulation classification, dimensionality reduction, trajectory construction, differentially expressed marker calculation, pseudotime estimation, intermediate state identification and visualization. The CytoTree runs on several platforms, such as UNIX, Windows, and macOS, and provides an up-to-date, feature-rich and readily scalable workflow.

**Installation**: To install this package, start R and enter:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# If not already installed
install.packages("devtools") 
devtools::install_github("JhuangLab/CytoTree")
```

CytoTree is also available on Bioconductor:

```{r eval=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("CytoTree")
```
CytoTree Tutorial is provided in <https://ytdai.github.io/CytoTree/index.html>

## 5.3.4 **VeloViz**
![](/images/VeloViz.png?width=15pc)

**Introduction**: VeloViz creates an RNA-velocity-informed 2D embedding for single cell transcriptomics data.

**Installation**: To install this package, start R and enter:

```{r eval=FALSE}
require(remotes)
remotes::install_github('JEFworks-Lab/veloviz')
```

VeloViz is also available on Bioconductor:

```{r eval=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("veloviz")

```
A example is provided in <https://github.com/JEFworks-Lab/veloviz>

## 5.3.5 **Asc-Seurat**

**Introduction**: Asc-Seurat (Analytical single-cell Seurat-based web application) is a web application based on Shiny. Pronounced as “ask Seurat”, it provides a click-based, easy-to-install, and easy-to-use interface that allows the execution of all steps necessary for scRNA-seq analysis. It integrates many of the capabilities of the Seurat and Dynverse and also allows an instantaneous functional annotation of genes of interest using BioMart.

**Installation**: To install Asc-Seurat, it is necessary to have Docker installed on the machine. Docker needs to be correctly installed and configured in the user’s machine. Check the installation instructions provided by Docker at (https://docs.docker.com/engine/install).

**Web server**: [Asc-Seurat](https://asc-seurat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

## 5.3.6 **VeTra**

**Introduction**: A tool for infering scRNA_seq trajectory from RNA velocity

**Installation**: The script works on python. R 3.6(or higher version) and "princurve" package in R are required. TF(Transfer entroy) inference needs openmpi installation on Linux OS. If you only want to infer trajectories of datasets, it is unnessary to install "openmpi" and "JPype".

## 5.3.7 **TIMEOR**
![](/images/TIMEOR.png?width=25pc)

**Introduction**: Temporally unified RNA velocity for single cell trajectory inference (UniTVelo) is implementated on Python 3 and TensorFlow 2. The model estimates velocity of each gene and updates cell time based on phase portraits concurrently. The major features of UniTVelo are: 1)Using spliced RNA oriented design to model RNA velocity and transcription rates. 2) Introducing a unified latent time (Unified-time mode) across whole transcriptome to incorporate stably and monotonically changed genes. 3) Retaining gene-spcific time matrics (Independent mode) for complex datasets

**Installation**: To run TIMEOR outside of website (recommended for preprocessing from raw .fastq files), users may use Docker and Docker Hub. First, the TIMEOR repository must be cloned (https://github.com/ashleymaeconard/TIMEOR.git). To use Docker, it must be installed (version 20.10.0 recommended).

**Web server**: [TIMEOR](https://timeor.brown.edu/app/timeor).
