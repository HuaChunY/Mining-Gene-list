## 3.4.1 **ENCODE**

- **Introduction**: The ENCODE Portal, developed and maintained by the Data Coordination Center (ENCODE DCC), is the canonical source for all experimental metadata and data from ENCODE and associated projects. The ENCODE Portal contains raw and ground-level analysis data generated by participating mapping centers using a wide-range of assays (integrative analysis data are available at the SCREEN portal. The Portal also stores records of the materials and methods used to perform the assays and subsequent analysis.

## 3.4.2 **starBase**

- **Introduction**: starBase is an openly licensed and state-of-the-art platform to decode the cellular interaction networks among thousands of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and various RNAs. We have identified millions of RBP-RNA and RNA-RNA interactions through analyzing thousands of CLIP-seq and various high-throughput sequencing data by developing new software and tools, and studied their functions and mechanisms in human diseases.

Coding genes are also covered, including atypical regions such as 5'UTRs and CDS. MicroRNA family definitions and names are consistent with TargetScan. Site conservation is evaluated based on 46 vertebrates species. Data sources and stats is found on the data info page, and the FAQ answers many questions. Please cite the miRcode paper if this resource is useful in your research.

## 3.4.8 **PceRBase**

- **Introduction**: Competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) act as decoys for microRNA (miRNA) binding, thereby regulating the abundance of other RNA transcripts which share the same microRNA response elements (MREs). Plant ceRNA database (PceRBase) uses mRNA, long non-coding RNA and miRNA sequence information to predict potential ceRNA target-target pairs (with identical shared MREs) and ceRNA target-mimic pairs (with one perfect MRE match, and one imperfect MRE match).

PceRBase currently predicts 696,756 potential ceRNA target-target, and 167,608 ceRNA target-mimic pairs from 28 plant species. Particularly, 239,998 ceRNA target-target and 75,360 ceRNA target-mimic pairs were found in Arabidopsis thaliana.
